LearningPortal is a platform built as a multifunctional tool that includes various login roles - public, student, teacher, business, and administrator.

Access to the pages and personal panels of users with different roles is achieved through a menu. The available information about the possible courses is displayed via an interactive dropdown menu.

The input data is processed through specialized forms.

To expand the functionality of the project, REST API and Amazon Web Services are used.

Incoming requests are validated through specially organized middleware and requests. Various queries are used to interact with the database, and emails are sent synchronously through a queue worker using events and event listeners, as well as a specific table.

The project is implemented using PHP, Laravel, and SQL as the backend, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are implemented for the frontend part.
